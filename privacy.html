            <h2 id="overview">Privacy Policy Overview</h2>
            <p>It is Derek Perry’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information Derek Perry may collect while operating the website. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://dp.design">dp.design</a> (hereinafter, “Derek Perry”, “the website”, or “<a href="https://dp.design">dp.design</a>”). Derek Perry respects your privacy and is committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide Derek Perry through the website.
