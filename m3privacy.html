                <h2 id="overview">Privacy Policy Overview</h2>
                <p>It is Derek Perry’s policy to respect your privacy regarding any information Derek Perry may collect while operating the game, Minimal Match 3. This Privacy Policy applies to <a href="https://dp.design/m3">Minimal Match 3</a> (hereinafter, “the game”, “Derek Perry's game”, or “<a href="https://dp.design/m3">Minimal Match 3</a>”). Derek Perry respects your privacy and is committed to protecting personally identifiable information you may provide Derek Perry through the game. Derek Perry has adopted this privacy policy (“Privacy Policy”) to explain what information may be collected in the game, how Derek Perry uses this information, and under what circumstances Derek Perry may disclose the information to third parties. This Privacy Policy applies only to information Derek Perry collects through the game and does not apply to the collection of information from other sources.</p>
                <p>This Privacy Policy sets forth the general rules and policies governing your experience with the game. Depending on your activities when playing the game, you may be required to agree to additional terms and conditions.</p>


                <h2 id="user-data">Game User Data</h2>
                <p>Like most game developers, Derek Perry collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that devices and servers typically make available, such as the device/device type, language preference, and the date and time of each user request. Derek Perry’s purpose in collecting non-personally identifying information is to better understand how Derek Perry’s game users play/use the game. From time to time, Derek Perry may release non-personally-identifying information in the aggregate, e.g., by publishing a report on trends in the usage of the game.</p>


                <h2 id="gathering-info">Gathering of Personally-Identifying Information</h2>
                <p>Certain users of Derek Perry’s games choose to interact with Derek Perry in ways that require Derek Perry to gather personally-identifying information. The amount and type of information that Derek Perry gathers depends on the nature of the interaction. Derek Perry runs analytics to understand how you interact with the game which should continuously improve your gaming experience (e.g. identifying that a feature is too difficult for most users).</p>


                <h2 id="security">Security</h2>
                <p>The security of your Personal Information is important to Derek Perry, but remember that no method of transmission over the Internet, or method of electronic storage is 100% secure.

                <p>If you send Derek Perry a request (for example via a support email or via one of the feedback mechanisms), Derek Perry reserves the right to store it privately in order to help clarify or respond to your request. Derek Perry takes all measures reasonably necessary to protect against the unauthorized access, use, alteration or destruction of potentially personally-identifying and personally-identifying information.</p>

                <h2 id="transfers">Business Transfers</h2>
